### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**dyerrington/dyerrington** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few side projects related to automated cryptocurrency trading and a fundamental Python for data science video series!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.js
- âš¡ Fun fact: One of my students was the Cambridge Analytica wistleblower

Originally I am from Alaska but have lived in the San Francisco Bay area for almost 20 years.  I've spent a lot of the past 5 years teaching people machine learning and Python while working at a mainstream bootcamp-type school.  More recently I managed data science at a mobile gaming analytics startup from a hands-on role building prototype applications and deploying machine learning models at scale.  Since the beginning of 2020, I've been consulting and contracting as a data scientist for a variety of projects related to traditional supervised learning, NLP, and working with students 1:1 from beginner to advanced ML topics.

When it comes to my professional interests, my favorite topics include machine learning, Python, and data visualization.  My ideal day consists of learning something new, building ideas from the ground up in a Jupyter Notebook, and sharing when I've learned with others.

## Currently, I'm working on:

- **Regularly updated Jupyter notebooks for learning ML and Data Science**
- A GPT2 model that generates terrible insults
- Cleaning up a Django project that hosts a topic model about the compendium of rap music
- Fun experiments with ML and magenta.js
- Building an app to help life-sciences people find weather anomalies

My next big project that is close to being released is an open source library of content for anyone looking to learn Python for data science.  I will post details sometime this Feb 2022.
